# Python-for-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-Bootcamp
This a repository containing the jupyter notebooks of the Udemy class with the same name as the repository. The instructor Jose Portilla goes through each one of the different libraries and concepts that lay the foundations of Data Science and Machine Learning. I consider it is a great class.
